summary: |
  As a seasoned Data Engineer with over four years of experience in developing scalable and reliable big data solutions, I have relocated to Gothenburg, Sweden, to join Software by Quokka. This high-end software engineering firm offers services to leading enterprises in sectors such as automotive, telecom, MedTech, and FinTech.

  Previously, at Globant, I played a pivotal role in designing, implementing and optimizing data workflows for major clients, leading to improved data processing efficiency and reduced operational costs. My work supported critical business functions and enabled data-driven decision-making in large-scale enterprises.

  Throughout my career, I have handled data for millions of users and processed billions of transactions. With a strong foundation in Python and SQL, coupled with hands-on experience in data modeling, ETL processes, and cluster management, I consistently deliver high-quality, scalable solutions.
